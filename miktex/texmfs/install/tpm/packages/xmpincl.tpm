The essence is that the metadata is stored in an XML file, and this XML stream is then embedded in the file to which it applies. How you create this XML file is up to you, but the author started investigating this because he wanted to embed licensing information in the files he created. The license the author chose is one of the Creative Commons licenses, and their web-site offers this information in a valid XML-file, suitable for direct inclusion.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="4131">texmf\tex\latex\xmpincl\xmpincl.sty texmf\tpm\packages\xmpincl.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1633291873</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>3922fba1ac6153607dd9bd8e2b4fe647</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/xmpincl"/><TPM:License type="gpl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
